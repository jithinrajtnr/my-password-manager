## Introduction

**`raspberry-password-manager`** (invoked as `passwdm`) is a zero-dependency Node.js CLI tool to:

- Generate strong, random passwords.  
- Encrypt them with AES-256-GCM.  
- Store them securely in your home directory (`~/.passwdm`).  
- Protect access via a master application password.  

---

## Features

- One-time setup (`passwdm init`) for master password & encryption key.  
- Interactive menu:  
  - **Generate** a new password entry.  
  - **Get** (decrypt) an existing password.  
  - **Delete** all entries for a site.  
- Automatic home-directory storage (`~/.passwdm/store.json`).  
- Built with standard Node.js libraries, plus [`inquirer`](https://npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [`chalk`](https://npmjs.com/package/chalk).

---

## Installation

### From npm

```bash
npm install -g raspberry-password-manager
```

> Once complete, `passwdm` will be available on your `PATH`‚Äîno manual linking required.

### From GitHub (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/raspberry-password-manager.git
cd raspberry-password-manager
npm install
npm link
passwdm init
```

---

## Initialization

Before first use, run:

```bash
passwdm init
```

This will:

1. Prompt you to **set** and **confirm** a master application password.  
2. Generate a **32-byte Base64** encryption key.  
3. Save both to `~/.passwdm/config.json` (file permissions `600`).  

> **Important**: backup your encryption key! If you lose it, stored passwords become irretrievable.

---

## Usage

Launch the interactive menu:

```bash
passwdm
```

You‚Äôll be asked for your master password, then presented with options:

- **Generate** ‚Äì Create and display a new password.  
- **Get**      ‚Äì Decrypt and show an existing password.  
- **Delete site** ‚Äì Remove all entries for a chosen site.  
- **Exit**     ‚Äì Quit the tool.

#### Example Session

```bash
$ passwdm
Enter application access password: ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
