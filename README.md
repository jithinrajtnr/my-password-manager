## Introduction

**[`raspberry-password-manager`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raspberry-password-manager)** (invoked as `passwdm`) is a zero-dependency Node.js CLI tool to:

- Generate strong, random passwords.  
- Encrypt them with AES-256-GCM.  
- Store them securely in your home directory (`~/.passwdm`).  
- Protect access via a master application password.  

Source code on GitHub: [jithinrajtnr/my-password-manager](https://github.com/jithinrajtnr/my-password-manager)

---

## Features

- One-time setup (`passwdm init`) for master password & encryption key.  
- Interactive menu:  
  - **Generate** a new password entry.  
  - **Get** (decrypt) an existing password.  
  - **Delete** all entries for a site.  
- Automatic home-directory storage (`~/.passwdm/store.json`).  
- Built with standard Node.js libraries, plus [`inquirer`](https://npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [`chalk`](https://npmjs.com/package/chalk).

## Installation

### From npm

Install the CLI globally so `passwdm` is available on your `PATH`:

```bash
npm install -g raspberry-password-manager
```

Or view the package on npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/raspberry-password-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raspberry-password-manager)

*Alternatively*, to include it as a dependency in another project:

```bash
npm install --save raspberry-password-manager
```

---

### From GitHub (development)

Clone the source and link the CLI for development:

```bash
# via SSH
git clone git@github.com:jithinrajtnr/my-password-manager.git

# or via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/jithinrajtnr/my-password-manager.git

cd my-password-manager
npm install
npm link
passwdm init
```

---

## Initialization

Before first use, run:

```bash
passwdm init
```

This will:

1. Prompt you to **set** and **confirm** a master application password.  
2. Generate a **32-byte Base64** encryption key.  
3. Save both to `~/.passwdm/config.json` (file permissions `600`).  

> **Important**: Backup your encryption key! If you lose it, stored passwords become irretrievable.

---

## Usage

Launch the interactive menu:

```bash
passwdm
```

You‚Äôll be asked for your master password, then presented with options:

- **Generate** ‚Äì Create and display a new password.  
- **Get**      ‚Äì Decrypt and show an existing password.  
- **Delete site** ‚Äì Remove all entries for a chosen site.  
- **Exit**     ‚Äì Quit the tool.

#### Example Session

```bash
$ passwdm
Enter application access password: ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

üîê  CLI Password Manager
